This fork adds php sites that are configured to use .dev domains. It looks for site folders on `~/Sites/php`. You can
configure this path to your own Apache `DocumentRoot` by changing all references to this path on [Anvil/NVDataSource.m](Anvil/NVDataSource.m).

This version does not work with Hammer!
